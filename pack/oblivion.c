Plats are always drawn in the extended position, so they will light correctly.

If the plat is the target of another trigger or button, it will start out disabled in the extended position until it is trigger, when it will lower and become a normal plat.

"lip"	overrides default 8 pixel lip

If the "height" key is set, that will determine the amount the plat moves, instead of being implicitly determoveinfoned by the model's height.

/*QUAKED func_rotating (0 .5 .8) ? START_ON TOUCH_PAIN LOOP ANIMATED ANIMATED_FAST
A generic rotating brush/set of brushes.  Be sure to include an origin
brush with the group and its origin will serve as the center of rotation
for the entire entity.  Use START_ON to have it rotating at level start.
Use the LOOP flag in conjunction with mangle and partial rotation.  
See mangle field desc for more info.

"mangle"    Takes x y z values, if set, does a partial move and stops.  
            if LOOP flag is set, does rotation over and over every wait
		    seconds.  Uses "speed" instead of "speeds".
"speeds"    Takes x y z values and allows for seperate speed values on
            each axis.
"durations" Used if mangle is set and overrides speed.  Specifies the
            number of seconds for each axis to get from starting to
			ending point of partial rotation.  Takes x y z values.
"speed"     determines how fast it moves; default value is 100.
"duration"  Used with partial rotation, specifies # of seconds to
            complete move.  Overrides speed value.
"dmg"	    Damage to inflict when blocked (2 default)
"accel"     Acceleration speed when activated, goes from stopped to speed
"decel"     Deceleration speed when deactivated, goes from speed to 0
"wait"      Used with mangle and loop to set wait between rotations

Good values for acceleration run from 20-100.
Acceleration isn't used with partial rotation... for now.

speeds		gives x y z speeds to rotate on specified axes

The train always takes the values of the NEXT corner for its moves.
For example, if you get to/start at a corner, and the next corner

/*QUAKED trigger_misc_camera (.5 .5 .5) ? MONSTER NOT_PLAYER TRIGGERED
Variable sized repeatable trigger for activating a misc_camera.
Must be targeted at ONLY ONE misc_camera.
"wait" - this is how long the targetted camera will stay on (unless its
         path_corners make it turn off earlier).  If wait is -1, the camera
         will stay on indefinitely.  Default wait is to use misc_camera's wait.
"delay" - this is how long the trigger will wait before reactivating itself.  Default
         is 1.0.  NOTE: This allows the trigger to trigger a camera that's still on.
"target" - this is the camera to target
"pathtarget" - this is the targetname of the entity the camera should track.
               The default is the entity that activated the trigger.
"message" - guess

HINT: If you fill a room with a trigger_misc_camera, then set the delay to .1 and the
wait to .2, then as long as the player is in the room, the camera will stay on.  Then
as soon as the player leaves the room, the camera will turn off.

/*QUAKED misc_screenfader (0 0 1) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) START_ON
fades the player's screen from the first color to the second color over count seconds.
colors are text strings of the form "r.r g.g b.b a.a".  They should be floating point
values between 0 and 1.  This is the same as the scale of 0 to 255 most people are used to.
r,g, and b are self-explanatory. a is the "alpha" component.  That is, how opaque/transparent
the color is.  0 is completely transparent, 1 is completely opaque.  So to fade a screen
from normal to black, you'd do
target "0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0"
pathtarget "0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0"

pathtarget	color 1
deathtarget	color 2
count			# of seconds

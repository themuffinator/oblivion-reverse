# Oblivion HLIL Interpretation

The files in this directory are generated by `tools/interpret_hlil_split.py`.
They turn the raw HLIL snippets that were exported into
`references/HLIL/oblivion/split` into structured assets that are easier to work
with during reverse-engineering.

Generated artefacts:

* `strings.json` / `strings.md` – string literals grouped by category. The
  metadata identifies the inferred purpose (for example sound paths, model
  resources or textual labels) and links back to the source HLIL snippet.
* `arrays.json` / `arrays.md` – numeric tables, jump tables and other global
  arrays, including an inferred primitive type for quick inspection.
* `controller_classnames.json` – automatically captured `target_*`/`trigger_*`
  classnames that were observed in the HLIL controller call graph along with
  their dispatch function and the split snippet that surfaced them.
* `summary.txt` – statistics that show how many items were interpreted and
  which HLIL snippets still need manual attention.

Regenerating the files only requires running:

```
python tools/interpret_hlil_split.py
```

The script operates without any external dependencies and is intended to be run
after additional HLIL blocks are split out or renamed.
